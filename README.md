# Wagtail Single Page Application Integration

This project provides some tools for using Wagtail as an API only CMS that a JS application will consume.

It was designed to work with angular-wagtail - but works without Angular if you provide the client integration.

## Features

- Wagtail Redirect API
- Preview button support (requires saving draft, unlike typical Wagtail)
- Get page detail view by html_path (faster than find_view's redirect and more compatible with non-browser platforms)
- Exclude pages by explicit site and/or page type
- Supports multiple wagtail sites
- Only adds features, does not break compatibility with Wagtail V2 Pages Endpoint
- Nothing in this package is Angular specific, you can roll your own JS client to work with this.

# Usage

- Install from pypi `wagtail-spa-integration`
- Add `wagtail_spa_integration` to INSTALLED_APPS
- Ensure API is registered by following [Wagtail's API docs](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.5.1/advanced_topics/api/v2/configuration.html). Use `wagtail_spa_integration.views.SPAExtendedPagesAPIEndpoint` instead of Wagtail's PagesAPIEndpoint.
- Add the redirect API view in your urls.py as you would for any rest framework ViewSet `from wagtail_spa_integration.views import RedirectViewSet`

## Multiple wagtail sites

Wagtail itself can support a base API url and multiple "sites" For example:

- A Base URL of api.example.com is where wagtail runs
- burkesoftware.com is one site served by wagtail
- passit.io is another site served by the same wagtail instance

This set up would require multiple Wagtail Sites and each Site needs it's own page.

- burkesoftware.com's Homepage should be a child of the root page and have a Site.
- passit.io's Homepage should be a child of the root page. And should have a Site.

`WAGTAILAPI_BASE_URL` must be set in settings.py so that the API shows the correct `detail_url` in the API.

## Usage with Angular

Follow instructions on [Angular-Wagtail](https://gitlab.com/thelabnyc/angular-wagtail).

## Usage without angular-wagtail

Review the angular-wagtail project and reimplement it's logic. Essentially you'll need to make a page router that loads pages from the api and connects wagtail pages to your view layer. For example a wagtail page HomePage would need to be connected to a JS HomePageComponent.

It's not likely that I'll be developing other integrations, but if you make an integration for your favorite JS framework I'd be happy to note it here. Angular happens to be a good fit because we can expect certain resources to be available (Router Module, transfer state, etc).
